/*
 * Block Spam Calls
 *
 * Description:
 * This application uses Twilio Add-ons from the Twilio Marketplace to block
 * unwanted voice calls. The 2 Add-ons used in this application are Marchex
 * Clean Call and Nomorobo Spam Score. The application provides the spam rating
 * of every inbound call to a Twilio number via the three Add-ons.
 * If the phone number is classified as spam by any of the two integrations, the
 * call is rejected. If the number isn't categorized as spam, the call will go through.
 *
 * Contents:
 * 1. Input Helpers
 * 2. Main Handler
 */

/*
 * 1. Input Helpers
 * These helper functions help read the results from the spam Add-ons 
 * in the incoming voice TwiML callback.
 * 
 * Function will return true if the call is classified as spam.
 * Otherwise, it will return false.

 * 2. Main Handler

 * the spam filters. If the call is flagged as spam by any of the 
 * spam filtering add-ons, the call will blocked by the <Reject> Twiml
 * verb. Else, the call will proceed and the Voice Response
 * will respond to the caller with a greeting.
 *
 * The callback will be used to return from your function
 * with the Twiml Voice Response you defined earlier.
 * In the callback in non-error situations, the first
 * parameter is null and the second parameter
 * is the value you want to return.

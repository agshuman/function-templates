# Voice IVR

This application allows users to navigate an IVR (phone tree) using keys or speech-to-text via a Twilio number. When a user calls the number, they are presented with three options: Talk to Sales, Hours of Operation, or Address. Selecting the first option forwards the call to a given phone number. The second provides an immediate voice response with relevant information. Choosing the third option triggers an SMS with the requested details. The application is fully customizable, allowing you to edit the available options and responses.

## Pre-requisites
- A Twilio account - [sign up here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

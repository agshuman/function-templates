On index.html you will see various fields and buttons that you can use. 

The 1st one is to insert the password. This is important as the app will not work without a correct password. 
To change the password, you need to open your function, click on Environmental Variables and edit the Password variable.

The 2nd one is the section that shows which Main account you are working with. 
Because this is a public URL, your account SID is masked by default and you can unmask it by inserting the correct password and clicking on "Show Account" button. If the password is incorrect, the message "Wrong password" will be displayed. 

The next section is to chose which number parameters you want to see. You can click on "Select all" to check all the boxes, in which case all number details will be displayed. 

In the following field, you can insert a subaccount present on the main account that you are working with, in order to show the numbers of that subaccount. Leave this field empty if you want to list the numbers that are present on your main account. 

In the next field you can filter results based on the country code. Use it to show numbers of a specific country or with a specific prefix. 

The next 4 buttons do the following:
- List numbers - displays in the browser all the numbers on the selected account
- Clear list - removes the numbers that were displayed in the browser 
- Download listed numbers - downloads the list of numbers that was displayed in the browser
- Download without listing numbers - this button allows you to directly download the numbers without listing them in the browser. It's used when you have a large amount (thousands) of numbers and listing them in the browser can cause delays. 

The "Use Pagination?" section helps when you have a large amount of numbers to extract. Use it to prevent timeouts along with the "Maximum amount of numbers returned per page" field.

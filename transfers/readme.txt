Instructions

On index.html you will see various fields and buttons that you can use. 

The 1st one is to insert the password. This is important as the app will not work without a correct password. 
To change the password, you need to open your function, click on Environmental Variables and edit the Password variable.

The 2nd one is the section that shows which Main account you are working with. 
Because this is a public URL, your account SID is masked by default and you can unmask it by inserting the correct password and clicking on "Show Account" button. If the password is incorrect, the message "Wrong password" will be displayed. 

The next section is to find out the SID of a number. You can insert the number in question (international format, for example +123456789), and when you press "Fetch" the number, numberSID, number status, address requirements, and account SID where the number is located will be displayed.

In the following field, you need to insert the SID of the number you want to transfer, the SID of the losing account, the SID of the gaining account, as well the BundleSID and AddressSID that will be associated with the number on the new account (depends on the regulatory requirements of the number).

When you click "Transfer", a pop up will be displayed where you need to confirm that you want to transfer the number. 

Be careful, as the number configurations will be lost as well the opt-out and A2P registrations (A2P registrations are related to US LongCodes only).
